# Streaming Service Data Queries

*This project was completed as part of the [CareerFoundry Data Analytics Program](https://careerfoundry.com/en/courses/become-a-data-analyst/).*


## Overview

A legacy movie rental company is planning to re-enter the market with a new online streaming service. This project supports the launch strategy by using SQL to query a relational database containing inventory, customer, and payment data—helping to identify revenue-driving films, high-value markets, and regional sales trends to inform content strategy and customer targeting.


## Key Questions
1. Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
2. What was the average rental duration for all videos?
3. Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
4. Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
5. Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?


## Tools Used 

- **PostgreSQL** - Relational Database
- **DbVisualizer** - Entity Relationship Diagram
- **Tableau** - Visualisation
- **Excel** - Sharing Results
- **Word** - Data Dictionary
- **PowerPoint** - Presentation


## Skills Demonstrated

- Database Setup
- Data Structure Interpretation | Data Dictionary Creation
- **SQL Query Writing** - Filtering | Sorting | Joining | Aggregating | Subqueries | CTEs

## Data Used

This analysis uses a modified version of the DVD Rental dataset originally provided as a sample database for learning and testing SQL with **PostgreSQL**. The dataset was adapted and provided by **CareerFoundry** as part of their Data Analytics Course.

## Takeaways

**Successes** - The project successfully used SQL to query a relational database and extract relevant information in response to specific business questions.

**Challenges** – The static and hypothetical nature of the sample data limited opportunities for deeper engagement with real-time stakeholder needs. In the absence of direct business interaction, interpreting findings into practical decisions remained largely hypothetical. Presenting results without feedback loops also limited iteration and refinement of analysis.

**Way Forward** - Future projects could benefit from working with more interactive stakeholder contexts or simulated business scenarios to mirror the iterative nature of real-world decision-making. Expanding the reporting output to include automated dashboards or integrations with business intelligence platforms could also support more dynamic data consumption.
