# Streaming Service Database Queries
*This project was completed as part of the [CareerFoundry Data Analytics Programme](https://careerfoundry.com/en/courses/become-a-data-analyst/).*

## Overview
A legacy movie rental company is planning to re-enter the market with a new online streaming service. This project supports the launch strategy by using SQL to query a relational database containing inventory, customer, and payment data. The analysis addresses a series of ad hoc business questions posed by management, helping to identify revenue-driving films, high-value markets, and regional sales trends to inform content strategy and customer targeting.

## Data
This analysis uses a modified version of the DVD Rental dataset originally provided as a sample database for learning and testing SQL with PostgreSQL. The dataset was adapted and provided by CareerFoundry as part of their Data Analytics Programme.

## Key Insights

## Takeaways
### Successes
The project successfully used SQL to query a relational database and extract relevant information in response to specific business questions.

### Challenges
The static and hypothetical nature of the sample data limited opportunities for deeper engagement with real-time stakeholder needs. In the absence of direct business interaction, interpreting findings into practical decisions remained largely hypothetical. Presenting results without feedback loops also limited iteration and refinement of analysis.

### Way Forward
Future projects could benefit from working with more interactive stakeholder contexts or simulated business scenarios to mirror the iterative nature of real-world decision-making. Expanding the reporting output to include automated dashboards or integrations with business intelligence platforms could also support more dynamic data consumption.
